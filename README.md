# healthcare-workforce

A source code repository for UMEC healthcare workforce needs, such as modelling, data transformation and visualization.

The analytical model relies upon Python; it is probably a good idea to install a conda environment as this will take care of most of the dependencies.

[Conda Installation](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html)

However the following packages will also need to be installed:
* PuLP (a Linear Program optimization capability)
* GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit)

Conveniently these can be installed as part of the conda distribution.

* conda install -c conda-forge pulp
* conda install -c conda-forge glpk
